A simple but efficient autoclicker made using PyAutoGui

The reason I made this is because the PynPut tutorials didn't work for me but PyAutoGui did

This could be used for AFKing games but if your playing Minecraft I'd highly recommend not to use this on servers without permission because you may get banned as autoclicking goes against many server's rules
